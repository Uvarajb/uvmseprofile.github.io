												<h3>Collaborative Discussion 1: Digitalisation – What are the security implications of the digital economy?</h3>
											</header>
											<p> <b> Initial Post </b>
											<br> 
											A completely digital enterprise is one that focuses on the flaws that exist inside an organization and finds solutions to improve network operations and the customer experience by utilizing digital technologies. The digital business cannot be viewed as a single department inside an organization; rather, it is a vast, all-encompassing force that involves each and every position within a company. However, the dependence on and key transition toward a digital enterprise are becoming increasingly important. Banerji (2019) 


<br>Because of the growing interdependence of many digital technologies and significant or critical infrastructure systems, a variety of new vulnerabilities have been established, each of which has far-reaching ramifications. The vast majority of organizations across all levels of industry, commerce, and government are strongly reliant on their information systems (IS), and they would quickly cease to exist if the technology (preferable information technology – IT and recently developed digital technologies) that supports their operations was ever rendered inoperable. ( Šimunic,2018) 

<br>In conclusion, I concur with both of the authors that any originations can't ignore the digital transformation of their organization. This is because customers increasingly anticipate having rapid access to the data or information that they provide. Due to the prevalence of increasing numbers of cyberattacks across all sectors, organizations need to exercise extreme caution while introducing new digital experiences.

</br> <b> Peer Response :  </b>
</br>Uvaraj mentioned that companies could not ignore the digital transformation. The digital world is constantly changing and evolving, and companies need to keep up to stay competitive. Ignoring the digital transformation would be a mistake that could lead to a company's downfall. As digital transformation continues to sweep through businesses of all sizes, SMEs may be disadvantaged. Larger organizations have the resources to invest in comprehensive cyber-security measures. However, SMEs often lack the same level of protection which can leave them vulnerable to attack, with severe consequences for their operations and reputation. As a result of COVID-19, many SMEs have lost their status and financial revenues, hence the need for technology adoption. People who thought they could survive without technology are now unable to do so (Shaikh et al., 2021).

</br>One of the biggest concerns for SMEs is data loss. Without adequate security measures, sensitive information could fall into the wrong hands, leading to identity theft, fraud, or other types of crime. In some cases, data breaches can result in hefty fines from regulators.

</br>Another critical concern is downtime. If an SME's systems are breached, they may be forced to temporarily shut down operations while dealing with the fallout, which can be costly and, in some cases, may even permanently put the business out of operation.

</br>Lastly, SMEs need to be careful about using emerging technologies, such as cloud computing and BYOD. They need to ensure that these technologies are secured and that data is protected. They also need to be aware of the potential risks of social media platforms, such as data leakage and reputation damage.

<b> Unit 1 Reflection: </b> 
</br>
we were introduced to history of network security and vulnerabilities and related it to the modern landscapes. We discussed the characteristics of a threat and a vulnerability, as well as other responsibilities within the industry. 
I started the first collaborative discussion on digital economy security. Banerji (2019) and Spermic and Simunic (2019) offer research on the digital economy and cybersecurity. It let me read "McNab, C. (2017) Network Security Assessment: Know your Network." O'Reilly Media" The book covered Network security assessment. In recent weeks, I've explored different tools. We read about the SolarWinds hack.

											<p><b>1. Discussion Topic and Learning Outcome </b></p>
											This week we will revisit the Cyber Kill Chain model proposed by Lockheed Martin (Hutchins et al, 2011) and apply it to a modern case study - the solar winds exploit (Temple-Raston, 2021) to explore if the well-known Cyber Kill Chain model is still as applicable for the analysis of modern Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).
											</br>In this unit we shall:
</br>1.Discuss the impact of APTs and review the Cyber Kill Chain model.
</br>2.Review the solar winds exploit (Temple-Raston, 2021).
</br>3.Evaluate if the model helps explain and mitigate the exploit.
</br> 
</br> 
</br> <b> Unit 2 Reflection: </b>
</br> we revisited the Cyber kill chain model proposed by Lockhead Martin (Hutchins et al, 2011) and apply it to a modern case study. Contributed to collaborative discission. 

</br>I had an opportunity to learn APT and Kill chain methods and reviewed National vulnerability database(NVD). I understand how Common vulnerabilities and exposures, common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) model works. I will be using this NVD database against the vulnerability during the scan.

												<h3>Unit 3</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This week we will review the different approaches to vulnerability assessments from paper-based processes such as Cyber Essentials, through a variety of vulnerability assessment approaches, to Crest-based and certified Penetration Tests. The lecturecast focuses on a general vulnerability assessment approach that can be used to create the basic audit document. This document should be used as the basis for more in-depth penetration tests.

</br>
</br>
<b>Scanning Activity:</b> 
</br>
Using the website(s) assigned to my in Unit 1, I carried out the following exercises and answer the questions listed below. Ideally, you should complete this task before the next seminar, where it will be discussed further.
<br>
<br>1.How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?
<br>2.Which step causes the biggest delay in the route? What is the average duration of that delay?
<br>3.What are the main nameservers for the website?
<br>4.Who is the registered contact?
<br>5.What is the MX record for the website?
<br>6.Where is the website hosted?
</br>
</br>
<b>Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Baseline Analysis and Plan:</b>

</br>
</br>
</br> <b> Unit 3 Reflection: </b>
<br>
I able to determine the right methodology, tools, and procedures to manage and/or resolve the identified security threats and vulnerabilities in network systems and analyzed these threats and vulnerabilities. 
The book “ TCP/IP Tutorial and Technical Overview” author by Praziale,L. et all(2016) provided a deep insight of TCP/IP knowledge. The book was very detailed provided  
</br>I completed the scanning activity for the webserver “allthegear.org.uk” and uploaded the results to eportfolio. 
</br>Baseline Analysis and Plan has been prepared and submitted, during the preparation I was introduced to new tools like Kali and revisited STRIDE, DRED and PCIDSS standards.

												<h3>Unit 4: Breach Analysis and Mitigation</h3>
											</header>
											<p></br>This week we will use the techniques covered so far to review and evaluate security breaches and formulate responses to typical attacks. We will also review the suite of tools contained in the Kali Linux distribution that are focused on security assessments and testing 
											</br>
											</br><b> Collaborative Discussion 2: The Pros and cons of logging – The impact of log4j </b>
											</br>
</br>Log4j is a tool that is utilized by developers so that they may monitor and record activity that occurs within their software applications. It is essentially to records everything that occurs within an application or system. The practice is known as 'logging,' and it is one of the methods that software developers use in order to monitor potential issues for end users. During November 2021 a critical vulnerability impacting the Log4j2 library was reported, resulting in several fixes and code revisions from the vendor (ANON, 2018) 

 </br>

</br>Pros:

</br>Logs are needed to protect against threats, find intrusions, respond to incidents, do forensics, help with court cases, and follow regulations. They are also used to measure IT performance and monitor and enforce internal policies and procedures. System logs are meant to give you useful information that will help to understand and spot problems that could become threats. 

</br>Good log practices can pay off in a big way at every stage of cybersecurity, from helping to profile activity to finding and stopping attacks to, if necessary, doing forensics and fixing problems after a breach. Log retention rules are necessary for enterprises because they guarantee that relevant data will still be accessible in the event that it is required to identify, prevent, or evaluate some future security problem. 
</br>
 

</br>Cons: (Andrew,E,2018 & Wistow, 2018) 
</br>1. Logging system size can grow 
</br>2. Logging information loss and integrity issues 
</br>3. Quality of logging data and efforts to log correlation programing 
</br>4. Log retention

</br>
 </br> <b> Peer Response</b>
 Hi Uvaraj,
Thank you for sharing your insightful thoughts om the advantages and disadvantages of logging.
You mentioned about having a good practice of logging. I do agree with you that this can help organisations at every stage finding and preventing attacks.
In addition to having a good practice of logging, it is important to ensure your need or purpose as an organisation to log and monitor such as compliance requirement, local laws and regulations, incident responses are considered. (Rana et al., 2022)
Identifying assets and events to be monitored up to a certain level is critical. With this, the organisation can use the logging to its potential ensuring the desired results are met for the purpose they chose to keep a log. (Rana et al., 2022).

											</br><b>Breach Analysis Case Study</b>
											</br>
											Marriott Beach was a breach analysis case study during the live seminar. My research revealed the beach's life cycle. Know how the company handles cybersecurity issues and informs government agencies. During that time, I installed Kali Linux on AWS and set up tools to scan the webserver. Nikito, NMAP, ZAB, SQLMAP, and others. Additional reading helps me understand penetration testing and password policy
											</br>
											
										
</br>
</br> <b> Unit 4 Reflection: </b>
</br>In the Unit 4, I had the opportunity to investigate the tools and procedures made available by Kali Linux in order to keep track of the vulnerabilities connected to the webserver that was given to me (https://allthegear.org.uk). 
</br>
</br>My research focused on the Log4j vulnerabilities and the impact those flaws had on a variety of applications. After investigating the scripts and running tests on the webserver, I compiled an executive summary of the scan results. I made a contribution to the topic "the Pros and drawbacks of logging - the influence of log4j" on the online discussion forum. The peer answer was also read by me, and I uploaded it.
</br>
</br>I also completed the scanning activity and captured the required information. Uploaded to the Eportfolio. 
</br>
</br>At the conclusion of unit 4, I had a solid understanding of how a standard breach attack is carried out, as well as the many alternatives for mitigating vulnerability assaults.

												<h3>Unit 5:</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This week we will discuss two topics key to breach investigation and resolution: logging and forensics. We will look at the differences between logging on Windows and Linux systems and review key tools used in logging. We will also review the types of investigation that can be carried out using common forensic tools.
</br> <b> Collaborative Discussion 2: The Pros and cons of logging – The impact of log4j </b>
</br> <b> Peer Response:</b> 


</br>You described logging as being highly recommended, which is excellent. Log aggregation and correlation are essential steps in the framework logging process (Betterstack.com, 2021)

You also said that the asset indentation and logging level are crucial, and I concur with your viewpoint.

</br>
</br> <b> Reflection: </b>
</br>
Logging and forensics are key to breach investigation and resolution. I understood how Windows and Linux log data and work together. We used forensics tools. This unit taught us about Kali Linux and its tool. We also examined PurpleSec's sample vulnerability report (Purplesec,N.D). We studied Penetest and SIEM papers. We learned how to prepare an organization for SIEM audit and compliance architecture. (2021 Swift). We explored Network virtualization using SDNs (SDN). SDN modernizes enterprise datacenters and public clouds. I deployed Cisco and VMware SDN in customer datacenters.

												<h3>Unit 6: </h3>
											</header>
											<p> Week 6, the final week of this module. This week aims to bring together the various threads and lessons discussed in the module to answer the question: what is the future of the internet? In answering this question, you should consider technical and security considerations as well as social, legal and privacy challenges.
											</br>
											</br> <b> Vulnerability Audit and Assessment - Results and Executive SummaryAssignment </b>
											</br>
											</br>
										</br> <b> Individual Reflective PieceAssignment </b>
											
											</br>
											</br> 
											</br> <b>The Debate – The Future of the internet </b>
											</br>
											</br>
</br>The seminar topic discussed various topic to content centric network, Peer-to-Peer overlay-based, Mobility First architecture and the adoption of IPV6. 
</br>
</br>In Content centric networking, CCN is a revolutionary networking model that emphasizes content distribution above host-to-host communication. This shift from a host-centric to a content-centric architecture has several compelling benefits, including a reduction in network load, low dissemination latency, and improved energy efficiency. It is questionable, however, whether current technology is prepared for the CCN (r)evolution. [Perino, et.all 2011)
<br>
</br><b>Peer-to-Peer:</b>
Internet computer and communications settings are more complicated and chaotic than classical distributed systems, without centralized organization and hierarchical control. Peer-to-peer (P2P) network overlays are popular because they enable large-scale data sharing, multimedia distribution, and multicast applications. P2P networks offer a self-organizing, massively scalable, and wide-area routing architecture that combines fault tolerance, load balancing, and locality. This study compares Structured and Unstructured P2P networks.Lua, Et.all 2004)
<br>
</br><b>MobilityFirst Newtork: </b>
Mobile platforms and apps are ready to replace the fixed-host/server model that has dominated the Internet since its birth, according to the MobilityFirst project. 
This anticipated, yet fundamental, transformation gives a rare opportunity to create a next-generation Internet where mobile devices, applications, and the resulting changes in service, trustworthiness, and management are main drivers of a new architecture. 
<br>
</br>MobilityFirst aims to scale, trust, and use mobile Internet entities. MobilityFirst is a clean-slate project that rethinks end-point names and connection-oriented protocols like TCP. (Rutgers, N.D) 
<br>
</br><b>IPV6: </b>
IPv6, the latest version of Internet Protocol (IP), will eventually replace IPv4. IP promotes data exchange between networks and defines the address and numbering scheme needed to connect devices to the Internet. IPv6 is not directly compatible with IPv4, but it supports the same Internet services and applications. 
Many groups are promoting IPv6 globally. IPv6 is needed to expand Internet infrastructure and connect more users and devices. (Internetsociety.org 2016)
